# Instance Segmentation of Mitochondria

## Problem Background
In biology research, it is a common and time-consuming task to manually label objects in microscope images. For example, to study the correlation between mitochondria count/size and heart disease, a researcher may have to quanity mitochondria in hundreds or thousands of images. An system that can automate visual identification tasks would save researchers countless hours in their work.

In this project, I aim to learn about deep learning methods for solving computer vision problems while applying these methods to solve a real world task.
